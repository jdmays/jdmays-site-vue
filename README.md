# jdmays-site-vue

## Overview

This is my jdmays.com website only in Vue.  The code is pretty trivial since there are no props to pass and no real data transformation is necessary.  It uses Vue Router for navigation.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate at least some minimal proficiency with Vue.

I will be doing a more thorough Vue project in the future.
