    <p class="text-block text-left my-4">
      I started with a career in Mental Health Counseling with a graduate degree in Counseling Psychology.  Information Technology is a second career; but it’s a career field that I’ve worked in for the last 15 years.
    </p>
    <p class="text-block text-left my-4">
      It wouldn’t seem like my earlier career in Psychology would have much in common with technology and programming.  The connection is that I like to solve problems and I like to do it in a methodical and systematic way.  To put it another way, I love it when a plan comes together.
    </p>
    <p class="text-block text-left my-4">
      I do not have any degrees in Computer Science or a related field.  But what I do have is an understanding of how to write clean code, the ability to listen to what the customer wants, and a willingness to learn and adapt to whatever challenges arise.
