      I live near Roscoe, IL with my wife and our two German Shepherd dogs.  We spend a lot of time outdoors hiking, kayaking, and traveling whenever possible.
      </p>
    <p class="text-block text-left my-4">
      I’m often in the middle of a construction project of one kind or another at our house.  In the past year or so I’ve built a chicken coop, a bridge over a creek on our property, a new dog house, and cleared a lot of invasive trees.
      </p>
    <p class="text-block text-left my-4">
      I call the chicken coop the Chicken Palace due to the fact that the chickens have heat, special lights, and ventilation.  Those chickens sure have it good.  Now if they will only lay some eggs.
      </p>
    <p class="text-block text-left my-4">
      Whatever you do, don’t ask me about dogs and definitely don’t ask about German Shepherd dogs, unless you want to get into a lengthy conversation about working line versus show line shepherds or the differences between shepherding styles of Border Collies and Germans Shepherd dogs.  Yes, we are “Dog People” but hopefully not like those other crazy dog people you might see on the internet.
